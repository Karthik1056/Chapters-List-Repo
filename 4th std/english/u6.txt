 A LETTER TO A DAUGHTER
 Introduction: Harshini’s father works in Delhi and he 
writes letters to his daughter 
regularly. Here is a letter.
 Dear Harshini,
 Hope you are fine and 
have got used to the hos
tel. I hope you have read 
some more books during 
your holidays. 
In my previous 
letter, I had written to 
you about the story of 


“Punyakoti.” Now I am going to write about of Ekalavya.
 Ekalavya lived with his parents in a forest. He used 
to hunt and fish for his living. He had a great desire 
to learn archery, but there was no one to teach him. 
He had heard about the great teacher, Dronacharya 
who lived in Hastinapura. Ekalavya went to Dronacharya 
and requested him to teach him archery. But Drona 
refused to take him as his student. He said that he 
was paid only to teach the princes of Hastinapura.
 Ekalavya was very disappointed. But his desire for 
learning was very great. So he thought of a plan. He 
made a clay model of Dronacharya and made it for 
his real guru. He prayed before the clay model and 
then started practising archery everyday. He continued 
this for a long time with deep interest and great 
concentration. Soon, he mastered the skill and became 
an expert archer.
 Harshini, don’t you think Eklavya was great? 
Remember where there is a will, there is a way.
 Now Harshini, you have all the facilities to stay 
in comfort and learn and very good teachers to guide 
you. Make the best use of these facilities and you will 
surely succeed. 
Have a nice day and take care, my dear.
 Your loving Papa,
 Basavaraj

 GIVE IT OUR ALL
 Anonymous
 Let’s never give in,  
to complaints nor fear.  
With our eyes on our goals,  
the right direction we steer.
 No matter the circumstances,  
with great effort we should always try.  
We must pick ourselves up,  
when we get bruised and we cry.
 Opportunities are plentiful,  
let’s just open our eyes.  
Our dreams we shall nurture,  
as we stare to the skies.
 The trick is to create value,  
that’s honest and real.  
By following our passions,  
in our hearts, we shall feel.
 If we never hold back,  
and just give it our all.  
No challenge or obstacle,  
shall ever be tall.
