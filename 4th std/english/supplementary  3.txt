THE TOOTH FAIRY
 Once there lived a little 
boy called Abdullah who loved 
to eat banana chips. He was 
so fond of them that he could 
never have enough of them.
 One night, Abdullah was 
busy munching and crunching 
his chips when he suddenly 
heard a loud “Carrack!” in his 
mouth. One of his teeth had 
fallen off as he was biting the chips! Abdullah remem
bered what his grandmother had once told him. “A tooth 
that has fallen has to be thrown over the roof.” He 
held the tooth in his hand and ran out of the house. 
“Go away, go away, big old tooth! Come out, come out, 
tiny new tooth! Go away, go away, dirty broken tooth! 
Come out, come out, clean white tooth!” he sang, and 
threw the tooth over the roof.
 Then he went to his room and lay down to sleep. 
As he fell asleep, he had a dream. A fairy, whose head 
had the shape of a tooth, stood before him. Her hands 
were full of teeth of different shapes and sizes. “Which 
of these teeth do you want?” She asked Abdullah. Ab
dullah chose a long pointed tooth, like the ones tigers 
have. Abdullah opened his mouth and stuck the long, 
sharp tooth into his gum. Then he tired to close his 
mouth. But the tooth was so long, that he could not 
close it. Besides, the sharp end was poking into his 
lip. “No, I don’t like this sharp tooth,” he told the fairy. 
“Please let me choose another one.” The fairy held out 
her hand once again. This time, Abdullah chose a tooth 
that had the shape of a rabbit’s tooth.
 Then he opened his mouth and stuck the bunny 
tooth into his gum. But when he closed his mouth, 

 
the tooth was sticking out. All 
his friends teased him about it. 
Abdullah got very angry. He pulled 
out the tooth and gave it back to 
the fairy. “I don’t want this tooth 
either.” She smiled and showed 
him other teeth to choose from. 
Suddenly Abdullah spotted a large 
tooth among them. He picked it 
up, opened his mouth and tired 
to fix the giant tooth in his gum. 
But it was so big that he could 
not even push it in. “Hey! This must be an elephant’s 
tooth!” he cried. “My dear fairy, none of these teeth suit 
me, please, could you choose the right one for me?” 
He asked.
 The fairy smiled, and held  out her hand. This time 
there was just one small tooth in it. Abdullah fixed it 
in his mouth and it fit him just right. Abdullah was 
delighted. “It’s not as sharp as nails, it doesn’t stick 
outside, it isn’t too big, it fits my mouth just right,” 
he cried. He sang and jumped up and down with joy. 
The fairy smiled and told him, “A tiger’s or rabbit’s or 
elephant’s tooth can never suit you, dear Abdullah. I 
have given you a tooth meant for humans. Take good 
care of it.” 
 Abdullah nodded his head and agreed to 
do as she said. As the fairy slowly disappeared,
 Abdullah woke up with a start. It was morning. He 
jumped up from his bed and looked into the mirror to 
see if the tooth that the fairy had given him was in 
his mouth. Yes indeed! In the place of the fallen tooth, 
a tiny little tooth peeped out! Abdullah remembered 
the fairy’s words and quickly went to the bathroom to 
brush his teeth.
