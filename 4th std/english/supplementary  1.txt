CHIMPU MONKEY
 Chimpu was a clever little monkey. He had lots 
of friends in the forest and they all loved him. One 
day, Jumbo the elephant went to meet  Chimpu. 
“Chimpu, look what I found in the forest! A man’s 
coat. I will give it to you as it will look good on 
you,” said Jumbo. Chimpu took the coat and looked 
at it and said; “Hey! It’s beautiful, I will wear it at 
once.”
 Just then Perky Parrot flew to them and cried out 
“Chimpu...! Chimpu..! Tiggy Tiger has chased a little 
monkey up a small tree. And Tiggy and his friend 
Billu Bear are now waiting below the tree to catch 
him. Poor little monkey! Please save him, Chimpu.”
 Chimpu was quiet for a while. Then, he quickly 
put on the coat, jumped on to Jumbo’s back and 
said, “Perky, you fly ahead and shout, ‘A hunter is 
coming...! A hunter is coming!’ I will take care of the 
rest.”
 Perky quickly flew to the tree and shouted, 
“A hunter is coming!” A hunter is coming! Tiggy  
Tiger heard the cry. “Is Perky telling the truth?” He  
wondered and looked around. Suddenly, in the distance, 

 
he saw someone wearing a coat and sitting on an 
elephant coming towards them. Foolish Tiggy thought  
Chimpu dressed in a coat was a man, a hunter. 
He was terrified. He shouted “Billu! Look! A hunter! 
Run! And Tiggy Tiger and Billu Bear turned and ran 
for their lives. When they were out of sight, the little 
monkey got down from the tree. He thanked Chimpu, 
Perky and Jumbo for saving his life and ran to his 
mother who was in a nearby tree.
