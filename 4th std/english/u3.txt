Let us read:
 CLEANLINESS IS NEXT TO 
GODLINESS
 Scene 
: A classroom
 Characters : A teacher and students
 Teacher enters the classroom
 ..................................
 Children : Good morning, Sir.
 Teacher : Very good 
morning, 
sit down 
children.
 Please 
answer your 
attendence. 
Anusha?
 Anusha : Yes, Sir.
 Teacher : Bharati?
 Bharati 
: Present, Sir.
 Teacher : Chetan?
 Mohsin 
: He is absent, Sir.
 Teacher : Do you know why he is absent?
 Rakesh 
: He is not well, Sir. He has malaria.
 Teacher : Oh! How sad.
 (Teacher after marking the attendance, starts 
the discussion.)
 These days many people suffer from malaria.
 Rita : 
What causes malaria, Sir?
 Teacher : Mosquitoes cause malaria. They also cause 
other diseases like dengue, chickengunya etc.

Savita 
: I have not heard of dengue, what is it 
Sir?
 Teacher : Dengue fever is a disease caused by a 
virus carried by mosquitoes.
 Savita 
: How do I know I have dengue?
 Teacher  : The symptoms are headache, rashes and 
body pain.
 Suresh : Is it infectious? 
Teacher : No, when a mosquito bites a person who 
has been infected with a dengue virus, the 
mosquito can become a carrier of the virus. 
If it bites someone else, that person  can 
be infected with dengue fever. The virus 
can’t spread directly from person to person.
 Suresh : How can we avoid this, Sir?
 Teacher : It’s easy, keep your surroundings clean, use 
an insect repellant, cover sleep areas with 
netting, avoid going outdoors at dusk and 
dawn, when mosquitoes are most active. 
Dirty water in the gutters and the ditches 
are the breeding places for mosquitoes.
 Students : We come to school and we don’t find time 
to clean them up.
 Teacher : You don’t have school on Sundays, you 
can spare sometime on Sundays to clear 
them up.
 Students : Good idea, Sir. We will make sure that we 
keep our surroundings clean.
 Teacher : That’s good. Remember, “Cleanliness is next 
to Godliness.”
 Students : “Cleanliness is next to Godliness.”



THE CLOCK
 I’m in the clock crew and I’m okay! 
I tick all night and I tick all day.
 I’ve got two hands, I’m having a ball, 
Because I’ve got no arms at all!
 My big hand can move sixty minutes in one hour, 
I’m the one with the strength and power.
 My small hand isn’t quite as fast, 
If they were in a race, it would come last!
 It takes so long just to get around, 12 hours you know, 
It’s careful, small, and slow.
 Now meet my friends that help me tick-tock, 
Half past, quarter past, quarter to and o’clock.
