LESSON _ 14
 TRAFFIC RULES
After studying this lesson you,
Âƒ know the traffic signals, traffic rules and follow them.
You have seen several sign boards by the side of the
roads while travelling or walking along the road. Do you
know what they indicate? Read the following picture
story.
Savitha, Fathima, Neeraj, Mary and their teacher are
standing on the footpath of a city road. A traffic policeman
is controlling the movement of vehicles.
Sir, Who is
standing in the
middle of the
road? Why is
 he standing
there?
He is a traffic
 policeman. It is a
 place where four
 roads meet. That is
the circle. Controlling
the movement of
people and vehicles
is his duty.
 

At that time another traffic policeman came near them.
Teacher introduced himself.
 Children, see
 there. There are
 white stripes in the middle
 of the road. It looks like
the stripes on a zebra. So it
is called zebra crossing and
pedestrians (people who walk
 on foot) should cross the
 road only at the zebra
 crossings.
So many
vehicles are
moving. How shall
we cross the
road?
 We should
cross the
road at Zebra
crossing
Sir, what is the
zebra crossing?
Where is it?

In the meanwhile Neeraj saw the signal light.
Sir, red light is
on there. All the
vehicles halt.
Why?
 That is the signal
 light. Generally we
find it in circles where
roads meet.
 These lights
 give specific
 instructions to the
 movement of vehicles.
 The red light indicates
stop, yellow light indicates
 get ready and green
 light indicates
 move.
There are red,
green and yellow
lights in the
signal light.
Why? 
In the meanwhile red light was on. The vehicles stopped
moving on the road where the teacher and students had to
cross the road.
They crossed the road at Zebra crossing.
 Stop, we should not
 cross the road when the
 red light is on. Another
signal light is there for
 pedestrians to cross the road.
 Look there, the green light
 is on. Now we can cross
the road on zebra
crossing.
Sir, red light is
on. Vehicles are
not moving. Shall
we cross the road
through zebra
crossing?
 Traffic lights are
 there in circles to avoid
accidents between the vehicles
or between the vehicles and
pedestrians and for the safe
movement of
vehicles and people.
Sir, Why do we
need signal
lights?
The children felt happy
knowing the traffic rules and
went to the school.

You have read the picture story, haven't you? Savitha,
Fathima, Neeraj and Mary have learnt some traffic signals
and their instructions from the traffic policeman. You have
