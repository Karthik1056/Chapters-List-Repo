Observe the pictures given on the

food are shown here. Arrange them in

Have you eaten food in a fair,
 in a village festival, an urs etc? Come,
let us go to our village fair. Look there,
people are moving together in a
procession. The beats of the drums are
getting louder. Tiger - masked dancers
and the keelu kudure are giving great
entertainment to the people gathered
there. People of the village have
prepared food for all those who
presented cultural items in the fair.

There is mass feeding. People co-operated for this
arrangement. They have given money,
grains, fire wood, etc. They together
have prepared the food. There are
different kinds of sweets. Come, let’s
have food. Some volunteers are
removing the leaves after the meal
and cleaning up the place of eating.
Let us join them. The people who
participated in the fair are going home
happily. They have the satisfaction of
sharing work and eating together.

Do you know that the people of different regions have
different food habits? For example, in northern districts
like Belagavi and Bidar most of the food is prepared from
jowar. Similarly in coastal districts like Mangaluru and
Udupi, cooking fish is special. In the districts of the plain
region like Mandya and Mysuru, ragi and rice are mainly
used as staple food
