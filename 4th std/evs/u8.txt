It was Deepa’s birthday. She likes carrot halwa very
much. Her mother had prepared carrot halwa for her
birthday. She ate well and slept well. She had a dream.
What did she dream of ? Carrot!
Carrot : Deepa, I am a carrot. You
had enough of my halwa.
Now, let me know what
you eat regularly.
Deepa : I eat well, different food
items everyday. I know how
and from which food items
are prepared.
Carrot : All right, make a list of all the food items that
you know and eat.


Carrot : Deepa, do you know the food you eat contains
the nutrients that give energy, help to grow
and protect health?
Deepa : No! I don’t know.
Carrot : These nutrients are: 1) carbohydrates
2) proteins 3) lipids or fat 4) mineral salts
5) vitamins.

 In which food items are these nutrients found?
Now know it from my friends.
 I am ragi. I have carbohydrates as the
main nutrient. I give energy to the body.

 Due to the shortage of carbohydrates one has to suffer
from weakness.

 Deepa, look here, I am cow beans. I have
a lot of protein. I help in the growth of your
body.
 
Carrot :Deepa,look here,
the butter. It has high fat
content. Groundnut oil,
coconut oil,sesame oil, ghee
also have high fat content.
Deepa : What is the use of fat?
Carrot : Even if we use a little fat, it's enough. Fat
 gives more energy than carbohydrates.
Deepa : Does it?
Carrot : Do you eat different vegetables, fruits and
 salt?
Deepa : Yes, I do. But I don’t like greens.
Carrot : Look Deepa, you have to eat all vegetables,
 greens and fruits. As they are rich in mineral
 salts and vitamins, they protect you from
 diseases and keep you healthy.

Carrot : Besides all the food items mentioned, beans,
 radish, leafy vegetables, fruits with edible
 skin(apple and guava) and cereals. They are
 rich in fibres and help in excretion.
Deepa : Is it possible to eat all these food items at
 a time?


Carrot : It is not so... You should eat all these food
 items daily in the right proportion. It provides
 the required amount of nutrients to the body.
 The food which provides all the nutrients to
 our body in a required proportion is called
 balanced diet. Besides you should drink
 4 to 5 glasses of water daily.
Deepa : How should the balanced diet be?
Carrot : Look at this chart and know about it.

Deepa : Animals and birds also need food as we do,
 don’t they?
Carrot : Yes, they also need food like us.
Deepa : How do animals eat food?
Carrot : See how animals eat food with the help of their
 beak, teeth and proboscis.

Deepa : Oh! It’s wonderful the way animals eat food.
Wait, I feel hungry once again. I'll come back
after eating halwa.
Deepa enters the
kitchen. She sees the
halwa being eaten by
c o c k r o a c h e s . S h e
screams.
Carrot : Why Deepa,
what happened?
Deepa : Cockroaches are eating halwa. Please drive
them away.
 I have to eat the halwa.

Carrot : No Deepa, Don't eat that halva. Once the
 animals touch the food item, it becomes
 contaminated. We shouldn't eat such food.
Deepa : What will happen if we eat?
Carrot : Read this news item.
Children fall ill by eating contaminated food.
 Children fall ill by eating the food exposed in a fair. It is
confirmed that contaminated food is the cause. The children
who ate the food which was contaminated by flies and
cockroaches are suffering from vomiting and dysentry. They
are admitted to a hospital. Four of them whose condition
is very serious are shifted to the city hospital for further
treatment.
Deepa : Poor Children !
Carrot : Come, I’ll take you to a nearby fair. Look
 at the shops where eatables are kept
 uncovered.
Deepa : Those house flies
 are sitting on the
 rubbish. They fly
 and sit on the
 sweets also.
Carrot : If we eat such food,
 we get diseases
 like cholera. So we
 should always cover the food with plates
 to avoid insects sitting on them. The
 vessels in which we store water for cooking
 and drinking should be covered. Care
 should be taken to avoid pollution of water.
 Hands should be washed before eating
 food. Understand?
Deepa : Yes, I understand.
Carrot : We shouldn’t eat stale food. We should
 wash the vegetables and raw fruits before
 eating them. Fruits should be cut to pieces
 just before eating. Vegetables should not be
 over cooked. Over cooking destroys the
 nutrients present in them. Food, if boiled
 well, will be soft and it digests easily.
 The germs present in them will also be killed.
 Eat hot food. Don’t eat oily, fried and
 too spicy food.
Deepa : Do you know, I am following all these tips?
Carrot : Then throw out the halwa eaten by
 cockroaches.
Deepa : OK.
Deepa threw the halwa, sobbing. Deepa’s mother woke
up Deepa, who was sobbing in her dream. Deepa woke up
suddenly and asked her mother why she hadn’t covered
the halwa with a lid. Mother laughed, and asked Deepa
whether she had a dream.
