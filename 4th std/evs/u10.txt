LESSON _ 10
 SHELTER - ITS VARIETY
After studying this lesson you,
 recognize the changes in the construction of houses from
time to time.
 identify the differences between the houses in the urban
and the rural areas.
 know about the multi-storeyed buildings and slums of
urban areas.
 find out the variety in habitats and shelters of animals.
 identify the variety in the nests of birds and dwellings of
animals and in the materials needed to build them.
You know about the need of a house, the materials
needed for its construction and the way of construction.
Let us know about the houses constructed in different
parts of our state.
Education department had organized a camp at
Dharwad. Children from different parts of the state
attended it. They discussed the houses of their region.
Come, let’s go there. The children are sitting there. They
are speaking one after the other. Let's also sit and listen
to them.
 I am Sangeetha. I have come
from Jevargi taluk, Kalaburagi
District. It’s a hot place with
scanty rainfall. People build
the houses using Shahabad
stones or slabs of stone. The
roof is constructed with wooden planks. Over
it they put mud. Some people place stone
slabs on it.

I’m John, I’m from
Koppa of Chikkamagaluru
district. Rainfall is heavy in
our place. People build the
walls with bricks or mud.
The roof is thatched with
hay (dry grass). The roof
is sloppy. Every year they
cover it with fresh hay. Once in
4 to 5 years they change the
entire hay roof. Some people use
hard red bricks to build walls and
make the sloppy roof with tiles.
In places like Chikkamagaluru,
where there is heavy rain fall, the roofs
of the houses are sloppy. Why?


I’m Haseena from Bengaluru. Now-a-days
people are constructing houses one above the
other. These are called multi-storeyed buildings.
Burnt bricks or bricks made of cement and
steel rods are used for the construction.
Flooring is done with colourful
tiles or marble. There is a facility
of staircases along with lifts. To
construct such multi-storeyed buildings
huge machines such as crane and mixer
are needed.

I’m Vivek. I am also from Bengaluru. My house
is near a slum. The houses there, are very small.
They build the house with bricks, dry leaves and
tin sheets.
The roof is either thatched with dry leaves or
covered with tin sheets. A few
people put tiled roofs. As there
is no drainage, the waste water
from washing the clothes,
bathing etc., stagnates in
front of the houses. Therefore
mosquito threat is common. In a
small area, hundreds of houses are
built close to one another. Therefore there is no proper
ventilation and lighting facility. And also the people who
stay there, do not keep their surroundings clean. They
dump the waste materials every where and dunghills have
been created there. The housefly and other insects sit on
the dunghills and spread diseases.



 Did you know that the houses are built depending on
the materials available in that locality and the climatic
condition?

Now let’s listen to the story told by
Venkajji.
Venkajji lived in a village for a
long time and then came to her
grandson's house which is in a
multistoreyed building in Bengaluru.
She was surprised at that splendour.
She sat on the sofa and went back to
the memories of her childhood days.
I was a small girl
then. I lived with my three sisters, two
brothers and parents in a thatched hut.
Our hut would leak when it rained.
During summer the leaves on the thatched
roof would dry due to heat, making holes
in them. One day our hut caught fire and was burnt down.
After that, my parents decided to build a house. My father,
taking the help of another person, built the mud walls.
My father brought bamboos from
the nearby forest. I, along with my
mother, brothers and sisters brought
small bamboos. We placed them on
the mud walls and spread mud /
clay on them. Later we went round
the open field and collected
cow dung. My mother mixed it with
water and plastered the floor and
the walls with it. We decorated the
front of the house, put rangoli and
entered the house.
I grew, and got married. I came
to my husband’s house. That house was better than ours.
The walls were built with burnt bricks and they were
white washed. The Mangaluru tiles were used for roofing.

The flooring was done with black
stone. The doors were made of
wood with beautiful carvings on it.
The broad windows allowed light
and ventilation into the house. Our
neighbours also had constructed
good houses similarly, but they used slabs of stone for
roofing. Cement flooring had a smooth surface.
I did not have to smear the ground
with cow dung or mud. I had to
cleanse the floor with water. Venkajji
who began to sip coffee, given by her
grandson, remembered the house of
her daughter. It was a concrete house
with marble flooring, coloured walls,
a small garden around the house and
a compound. Her house with all these
facilities was really beautiful.
Venkkajji is now looking at the apartment of her
grandson. 15-20 storeyed building with more than 500
houses. There is a lift service to reach houses on the top
floors. Certain machines were used to construct these
houses. There are three bed rooms, dining room, and a
living room in this house. Every thing is really fine. Still
houses are constructed like match boxes arranged closely.
There is some problem of ventilation and light. Wardrobes
are constructed to arrange the household articles in an
orderly fashion. Doors and windows are not of wood. They
are made of steel or plastic.
Venkkajji was surprised to observe the changes in the
construction of houses from the huts to multi-storeyed
buildings.
