Behind the bush upon the mound, 
ants are moving with no sound. 
Leaves are passed along the chain, 
ants as one, a single brain.

Strands of silver make a net, 
unseen web, a silent threat. 
Fly is caught; itâ€™s far too late, 
spider comes to seal his fate.

 
Ants march on to feed the queen, 
deep below she is unseen. 
Workers feed the silent drones 
in their capsule breeding zones.

Spider shoots its web to reach 
across the ever widening breach. 
Swinging on a single thread 
beyond the gap the web is spread.
