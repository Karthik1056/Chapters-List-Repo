I’m in the clock crew and I’m okay! 
I tick all night and I tick all day.
I’ve got two hands, I’m having a ball, 
Because I’ve got no arms at all!

My big hand can move sixty minutes in one hour, 
I’m the one with the strength and power.
My small hand isn’t quite as fast, 
If they were in a race, it would come last!

It takes so long just to get around, 12 hours you know, 
It’s careful, small, and slow.
Now meet my friends that help me tick-tock, 
Half past, quarter past, quarter to and o’clock.
