Introduction: Harshini’s father works in Delhi and he writes letters to his daughter regularly. Here is a letter.

Dear Harshini,

  Hope you are fine and have got used to the hostel. I hope you have read some more books during your holidays.

  In my previous letter, I had written to you about the story of 

“Punyakoti.” Now I am going to write about of Ekalavya.

  Ekalavya lived with his parents in a forest. He used to hunt and fish for his living. He had a great desire to learn archery, but there was no one to teach him. He had heard about the great teacher, Dronacharya who lived in Hastinapura. Ekalavya went to Dronacharya and requested him to teach him archery. But Drona refused to take him as his student. He said that he was paid only to teach the princes of Hastinapura.

  Ekalavya was very disappointed. But his desire for learning was very great. So he thought of a plan. He made a clay model of Dronacharya and made it for his real guru. He prayed before the clay model and then started practising archery everyday. He continued this for a long time with deep interest and great concentration. Soon, he mastered the skill and became an expert archer.

  Harshini, don’t you think Eklavya was great? Remember where there is a will, there is a way.

  Now Harshini, you have all the facilities to stay in comfort and learn and very good teachers to guide you. Make the best use of these facilities and you will surely succeed. 

 Have a nice day and take care, my dear.

Your loving Papa,
 Basavaraj
