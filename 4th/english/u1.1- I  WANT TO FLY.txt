If I had a pair of wings, with which to fly, 
I’d soar straight away, up into the sky.

I’d carry a brush,  
and paints in colours bright,  
So I could paint  
every fluffy cloud in sight!

I’d paint them purple  
and yellow and green-  
They’d be the prettiest  
you’ve ever seen!

I’d paint rainbows in the sky  
every single day,  
So I can watch them  
when I work and play.
 And when the moon and  
stars come out at night-  
Perhaps I’ll paint them too,  
for my delight!
