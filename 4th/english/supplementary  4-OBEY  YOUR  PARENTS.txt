There lived a little fawn with his mother.

The fawn thought that he always had to go everywhere with his mother.

Now he was grown up.

He could go alone to places, but his mother did not allow him.

The fawn found it very frustrating and decided to sneak off alone without informing anyone.

On a hot summer day, when the fawn’s mother was asleep, he slipped out from there.

He went to an open field and began to play hither and thither and found it very thrilling.

After some time he felt thirsty.

He went to a nearby stream to drink water.

After he had finished drinking water, he saw a lion staring at him from the upper side of the stream.

The lion was licking his lips and planning to eat him.

The fawn was aghast to see a lion with red and burning eyes, lolling his tongue with a clear intention to devour him.

He began trembling with fear.

He did not know what to do.

The lion called him and said, “You have spoilt the water.

You know I am drinking the water that has been made dirty by you.”

The fawn started moving backward slowly and said, “Sir, how can I spoil the water?

It is flowing from your side towards me.”

The lion did not know what new blame to put on him again.

Suddenly he heard a deer calling the fawn.

The fawn ran quickly to his mother.

Within a few seconds, they were out of sight.

The lion was disappointed.

It is correctly said that children should obey their parents in order to avoid getting into difficulties.
