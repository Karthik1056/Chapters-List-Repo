It takes a big heart and a brave soul,
 To drive someone’s troubles away,
 Everyone promises to offer help tomorrow,
 But very few can step forward to help today,
 Those who dare to act right now, rather than later
 Know the real meaning of kindness.
 It is this urge of wanting to make a visible difference,
 Is when kindliness actually becomes godliness.
