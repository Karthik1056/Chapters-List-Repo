 A table with chairs, that welcome sight.
 Our family, our friends, pure delight.

 A caring kiss with a gentle smile.
 Each tender hug lasts that country mile.

 The presence of love so fills the air.
 This gift of God brings our hearts so near.

 Reflections of past bring nurtured thought.
 Great visions come by, what life has taught.

 In thankful ways we embrace this day.
 And often think of loved ones away.

 Those serving us proud are often gone.
 But their spirit remains, closely drawn.

 Our Nation should praise each special one.
 For all we have is through what they’ve done.

 The freedom to have Thanks giving Day.
 Keeps certain plates bare, please truly pray.
