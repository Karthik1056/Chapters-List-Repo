 A table with chairs, that welcome sight
 Our family, our friends, pure delight

 A caring kiss with a gentle smile
 Each tender hug lasts that country mile

 The presence of love so fills the air
 This gift of God brings our hearts so near

 Reflections of past bring nurtured thought
 Great visions come by, what life has taught

 In thankful ways we embrace this day
 And often think of loved ones away

 Those serving us proud are often gone
 But their spirit remains, closely drawn

 Our Nation should praise each special one
 For all we have is through what theyâ€™ve done

 The freedom to have Thanks giving Day
 Keeps certain plates bare, please truly pray.
