Chimpu was a clever little monkey.

He had lots of friends in the forest and they all loved him.

One day, Jumbo the elephant went to meet Chimpu.

Chimpu, look what I found in the forest! A man’s coat.

I will give it to you as it will look good on you, said Jumbo.

Chimpu took the coat and looked at it and said; Hey! It’s beautiful, I will wear it at once.

Just then Perky Parrot flew to them and cried out Chimpu Tiggy has chased a little monkey up a small tree.

And Tiggy and his friend Billu Bear are now waiting below the tree to catch him.

Poor little monkey! Please save him, Chimpu.

Chimpu was quiet for a while.

Then, he quickly put on the coat, jumped on to Jumbo’s back and said, Perky, you fly ahead and shout, A hunter is coming A hunter is coming! I will take care of the rest.

Perky quickly flew to the tree and shouted, A hunter is coming! A hunter is coming!

Tiggy Tiger heard the cry.

Is Perky telling the truth? He wondered and looked around.

Suddenly, in the distance, he saw someone wearing a coat and sitting on an elephant coming towards them.

Foolish Tiggy thought Chimpu dressed in a coat was a man, a hunter.

He was terrified.

He shouted Billu! Look! A hunter! Run! And Tiggy Tiger and Billu Bear turned and ran for their lives.

When they were out of sight, the little monkey got down from the tree.

He thanked Chimpu, Perky and Jumbo for saving his life and ran to his mother who was in a nearby tree.
