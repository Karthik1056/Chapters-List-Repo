Santhosh was a student of class - IV. His teacher gave him homework everyday. Santhosh usually reached home at 4 pm. He would have his snacks and then do his homework. One day, Santhosh returned from school. He was happy to see his cousin, Sandhya. She had come to play with him. Santhosh played with Sandhya the whole evening. He forgot to do his homework. The next day, his teacher asked him, “Why haven’t you done your homework?” Santhosh did not reply. But suddenly he thought of an excuse and said, “I had fever, madam.” The teacher thought it was true and excused him. 
  
Now, Santhosh felt very sad. During the lunch break he sat alone under a tree. He did not eat his food. Suguna, Santhosh’s sister, was studying in the seventh standard in the same school. She saw her brother sitting alone and came to him. “Why are you not eating? You are looking dull. What happened?”  She asked. Santhosh kept quiet for sometime and then started weeping. Suguna waited for her brother to speak. Slowly, Santhosh started, “Yesterday, I played with Sandhya and forgot to do my homework. But I lied to my teacher,” Suguna listened to him patiently.Then she said, “Don’t worry. Get up. Let us go to your teacher. Admit your mistake before the teacher.” Both Santhosh and Suguna went to the teacher. The teacher asked, “What do you want?” Suguna looked at Santhosh. Tears rolled down his cheeks. The teacher asked Santhosh, “What makes you weep?” Santhosh replied, “Madam, I lied to you in the morning. I was not sick. I played the whole evening and I did not do my homework, Please excuse me.” The teacher felt very happy.  She consoled him and said, “You have admitted your mistake and now You have told the truth. Being truthful is always good.”
