Let’s never give in,  
to complaints nor fear.  
With our eyes on our goals,  
the right direction we steer.

No matter the circumstances,  
with great effort we should always try.  
We must pick ourselves up,  
when we get bruised and we cry.

Opportunities are plentiful,  
let’s just open our eyes.  
Our dreams we shall nurture,  
as we stare to the skies.

The trick is to create value,  
that’s honest and real.  
By following our passions,  
in our hearts, we shall feel.

 If we never hold back,  
and just give it our all.  
No challenge or obstacle,  
shall ever be tall.
