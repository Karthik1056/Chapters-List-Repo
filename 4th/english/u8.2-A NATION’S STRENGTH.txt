                      Ralph Waldo Emerson
 Not gold, but only men can make
 A people great and strong;
 Men who, for truth and honour’s sake
 Stand fast and suffer long;

 Brave men who work while others sleep
 Who dare while others fly;
 They build a nation’s pillars deep
 And lift them to the sky.
