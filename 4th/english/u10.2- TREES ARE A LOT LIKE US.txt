 I’d like to take a walk in the woods
 Come with me, do you think you could
 We’ll find a tree that we can climb
 We’ll have fun all afternoon

 Little trees need a chance to grow
 It takes time and care
 They’re a lot like us you know

 So many kinds of different trees                       
 They look like one big family 
 Big ones, short ones, baby ones too
 I’ll name this one after you

 It’ll be a long time before he 
 Is tall and strong like a grown up tree
 For now he’s just a kid like us
 Playing out in woods.
