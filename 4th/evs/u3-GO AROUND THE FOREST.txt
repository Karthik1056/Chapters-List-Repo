Sita lives with her family on the outskirts of a forest.

Besides her family, there are many other families too.

Sita loves the forest and the trees in the forest.

Now she will introduce the forest where she lives.

Listen to her.

Come, I’ll introduce my forest.

See, here are teak, sandal wood, matti and honne trees.

They are surrounded by creepers with fragrant flowers.

Look at the monkeys swinging and snakes crawling on the trees.

Look at the herds of elephants and deer.

Trees provide shade for all.

Oh! Sweet fruits.

Have you ever tasted these fruits? Come, taste these fruits.

How big and beautiful is my forest! This is my sweet home.
