On a lovely morning many girls in the school had plaited their hair and wore jasmine flowers on their plaits.

Teacher : Oh ! There is good fragrance in this room !

Haseena : Sir, some girls have jasmine flowers on their plaits.

Vijaya : Yes, now it is the season of Jasmine flowers, isn't it?

Teacher : In summer there is jasmine, in rainy season there is dahlia and in winter there is chrysanthemum. Thus, there are different flowers in different seasons.

Teacher : Come let’s go to the nearby garden and get introduced to a variety of flowers. But nobody should pick flowers. (All of them went to the garden)

Haseena : Oh! So many flower blossoms! The garden looks very beautiful. There is also a sign board Don’t pick flowers.

Teacher : Yes, follow that instruction. You also practise growing flowers near your home and the school.

Nagaraja : Look, there are flowers even in that pond.

Teacher : Children, name 3 flowers
Do you use flowers?
Do your family members use flowers?
Do you grow or buy the flowers used at home?

Girija : Shahina’s father has a flower stall.

Vijaya : Shahina, from where do you get flowers?

Shahina : My father buys flowers from the market. All of us at home string them.

Teacher : Shahina, what’s the price of jasmine flower per kg? How do you sell it after you string them?

Shahina : Today’s price of jasmine flower is ₹ 250 per kg. We sell at ₹ 10 for a cubit length.

Teacher : Do you know about the cubit length and yard?


Fathima : Yes, one yard is equal to four cubit length.

Teacher : These are units of informal measurement. Use of these measurements is useful to the people who string flowers, sellers and buyers of flowers.

Teacher : Plant the saplings of flower plants in the yard of your house or grow them in pots. Practise to use
flowers.

Vijaya : Sir, Haseena’s dress has the design of so many flowers on it.

Teacher : Yes, you can see the designs of flowers on different things. Flowers inspire the painter.
