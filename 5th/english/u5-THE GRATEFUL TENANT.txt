A settled home life gives everyone a chance to shine.

Read how one man remembers with affection the help that an elderly couple gave him when he was a penniless student.

I went for morning walks every day.

I enjoyed the stroll because of the scented breeze that blew from nearby gardens and also the mild warmth of the early sun.

On one such day, I noticed a plaque on the wall near the gate entrance.

It had the name of the house, Shyamkamal, engraved on polished black granite.

I asked Ramesh why he had chosen this name for his home.

It is a combination of the names of the two people who changed my life—the ones I remember and thank each day, said Ramesh.

Shyamkamal stands for Shyama Rao and Kamala.

Do you remember when I was in Dharwad, I used to stay with an old couple?

I remembered that there was an elderly couple in Dharwad who used to rent out their outhouse to college students, and Ramesh had stayed there for six years.

Ramesh went on to say that at that time they supported him wholeheartedly in his decision to study in a bigger town.

Shyama Rao was a retired postmaster and his father’s friend, and he gave him a place to stay.

Kamala Bai was so selfless that she would share her meals with him, and he enjoyed them so much that he felt as if he was eating with his mother.

As Dharwad was famous for peda, Mr.

Shyama Rao always brought pedas.

They never let him go hungry and treated him like their son.

If he was late in paying his college fees, Shyama Rao would lend money from his meagre pension to help him.

I reminded Ramesh that he used to run errands for them and do odd jobs like going to the post office, buying fruits and vegetables, watering plants, and pumping water from the tank, and that we even called him their Man Friday behind his back.

Ramesh disagreed and said that the old couple, though not well off, went out of their way to help him, and without their support he did not know where he would be today.

When I asked again why he named the house after them, Ramesh said it was his father’s suggestion.

His father believed that some people do things out of affection and not merely out of duty, and they change lives through love and generosity.

Ramesh wanted his children to know the origins of his success and to understand the gratitude he felt toward Shyama Rao and Kamala Bai, not just through words but through actions.

It is people like Ramesh who reaffirm our faith in humanity.
