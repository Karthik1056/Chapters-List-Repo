She looks out at me,From the yellowing photograph Misted	over by	time.

It is a frank and serious look.Her eyes are stern But they can laugh too.

Her hair is pulled back Tightly in a bun,And on her black dress She wears no jewelry.

I never knew her,Yet I recognize myself in her Three generations later.

May my great grandchildren Feel as close to me As I now do to her.
