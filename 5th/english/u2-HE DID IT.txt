Said the dangerous sea,
You’ll not conquer me,
Try as hard as you can.
You are not a whale,
You are not a shark,
You cannot walk
On the waves, young man.

So he made a boat
That was able to float
Ho, ho said his foe,
It floats all right
And it’s watertight,
But you can’t make it go.

Oh yes I can,
Replied the young man.
And he made some oars
And learned how to row.

When the sea saw
The boats and the oars
And all the rowers,
He said, Young man,
They make a fine show,
But what will you do
When they venture out

Where the deep sea swells
Can take them up
And toss them about
Like cockshells

You can’t stump me,
Said the bright young man,
And cut down a tree
And made a tall mast
And rigged it with sails
To catch the high winds
And weather the gales.

When the ships set out
With their sails unfurled
To cross the Atlantic
And discover the world,
The sea looked them over.

From stern to stern
And when he saw,
With considerable awe,
That Columbus himself
Was on one of them,
He said, with a show
Of humility,
I admit, young man,
You have conquered me.
