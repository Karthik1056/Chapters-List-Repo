Air is one of the important natural resources.

The Earth is surrounded by layers of air called the atmosphere.

Air is a mixture of many gases and is essential for sustaining the life of plants and animals.

Air consists mainly of nitrogen (78%), oxygen (21%), carbon dioxide (0.04%), along with water vapour, noble gases, and dust particles (0.96%).

The mixing of harmful chemicals, dust, and microorganisms into the air is called air pollution.

Air becomes polluted when chemicals and microscopic smoke particles from industries and vehicles mix with it.

Air pollution causes serious health problems such as heart disease, cancer, and breathing disorders.

It also negatively affects plant growth and crop yield, and may even lead to the extinction of some animal species.

Since all living organisms need air, it is essential to prevent air pollution.

Therefore, we must take necessary measures to control and reduce air pollution.
