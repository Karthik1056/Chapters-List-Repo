Our Earth consists of essential resources that support life.

Water, soil, air, minerals, plants, animals, and other substances that occur naturally on Earth are called resources.

These resources are necessary for all living organisms, including humans, and they are among the most valuable elements for the progress of mankind.

Resources such as solar energy, air, water, soil, and forests are available in nature even after usage.

Since they are continuously available over the period of a human lifetime, they are called renewable resources.

On the other hand, resources like coal, petrol, diesel, and natural gas will get exhausted due to continuous use.

These resources cannot be renewed and are therefore called non-renewable resources.

Solar energy is the energy obtained from the Sun, which is the main source of heat and light for the Earth.

We receive both heat and light from the Sun, and plants use solar energy to prepare their food.

Air and water are also natural resources, and their importance will be discussed in detail in later units.

Soil is another important renewable resource.

We walk on soil and live on it.

Soil is essential for the growth of plants, as it supplies water and minerals needed for food preparation.

You will learn more about soil in higher classes.

Forests are the natural habitat of wild animals and birds.

They provide food and shelter to animals and supply many useful materials to humans.

Forests can be conserved by restricting unnecessary cutting of trees, planting more trees, using forest products properly, and preventing forest fires caused by cutting tree branches.

The Government amended the National Forest Policy in 1988 and has taken several steps to protect and conserve forests.

Many movements have also taken place against deforestation when large-scale projects were proposed.

Fuels are substances that release heat and energy when burned, and they are used for various purposes.

Petroleum is a liquid mineral found beneath the Earth’s surface, formed due to the action of bacteria, heat, and pressure on dead organisms buried under rock layers.

Petrol, diesel, kerosene, wax, and other products are derived from petroleum.

By-products like wax and paraffin are used in making candles, wood polish, ointments, dyes, lipsticks, fertilizers, and petroleum jelly.

Natural gas is found along with petroleum in wells, and compressed natural gas is used as an alternative fuel to petrol and diesel in vehicles.

Coal was formed millions of years ago from the remains of plants and trees buried under the Earth’s crust.

Due to high temperature and pressure, they turned into coal, which is widely used for electricity generation and in industries.

Mineral resources are formed in the Earth through long natural processes.

They are found along with rocks on the Earth’s surface.

Minerals are extracted as ores, refined in factories, and metals are separated from them for various uses.
