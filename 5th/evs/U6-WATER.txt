Water is very essential for the life of plants and animals.

Crops cannot be grown without water, and it is a basic need for all living beings.

Water has many uses, so it is a very important resource and is rightly called the life liquid.

About 71% of the Earth’s surface is covered with water.

Rain is the main source of river water.

During summer, melted snow from mountains also reaches rivers, causing them to overflow.

All rivers flow along definite routes and finally reach the oceans.

Water stored beneath the Earth’s crust comes out due to pressure through an opening and is called a spring.

Rainwater that seeps into the loose layers of soil collects as underground water and emerges in the form of springs.

Underground water obtained by digging the Earth’s crust to a certain depth is called well water.

A pond is an artificially made low-lying area of land constructed to store water.

Its water-holding capacity is less.

Ponds are designed to collect rainwater that drains from higher ground and also receive water through rivulets or small streams.

Dams are built across rivers to store water throughout the year and supply it to areas facing scarcity.

These large water storage structures are called reservoirs and are also used for multipurpose projects.

Pure water is colourless, odourless, and tasteless.

The salts and minerals dissolved in water are responsible for its taste.

Water is a liquid substance, and you will learn more about its physical nature in the lesson on the nature of matter.

Water has great biological importance.

Living organisms contain a large amount of water in their bodies, and both plants and animals have about 70% water content.

The earliest forms of life originated in water.

Water is essential for all biological activities of plants and animals, including growth.

Green plants require water for the preparation of their food.

Water pollution occurs when water is physically contaminated with mud, garbage, paper, and food waste.

When water gets mixed with industrial chemicals, chemical fertilizers, and insecticides containing harmful substances, it becomes poisonous.

Drinking such polluted water can cause diseases like cholera, diarrhoea, and dysentery, and in some cases may even lead to death.

Contaminated water also destroys aquatic life.
