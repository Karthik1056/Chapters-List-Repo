A group of people living in a specific area is called a community.

Members of a community are interdependent on one another for many needs, and a community is known by many names.

When many families live together in a village, the group of all these families is called a community.

Ravi’s house is in Anandapura.

His father was born and brought up in that village, and likewise many people have been living there for several years.

When there is a function in someone’s house, everybody helps.

Being a farmer, Ravi’s father depends on others to get his work done.

There are different types of communities such as rural communities, urban communities, and tribal communities.

In India, about 72% of the total population lives in villages.

Agriculture is the major occupation of nearly 70% of these people.

Along with agriculture, other occupations such as dairy farming, poultry, fishery, sericulture, weaving, blacksmithing, carpentry, basket weaving, and many others are also practiced in villages.

Agricultural activities are completely dependent on rainfall.

Villages face problems related to hygiene, health, education, and employment.

To address these issues, the government has introduced several rural development programmes such as Rozgar Yojana and Jawahara Gram Samruddi Yojana for self-employment of educated rural youth, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyana to provide quality education, Nirmala Grama Yojana for village cleanliness, Bhagyalakshmi Yojana for the better future of girls, and Ashraya Yojana to provide free sites, grants, and loans for building houses for the poor.

India has nearly five thousand cities, and 27 of them have a population of one million or more.

Bengaluru, the capital city of Karnataka, is one among them.

It is the responsibility of every citizen living in cities to keep them clean.

People should cooperate with the government to maintain cleanliness and live with cooperation, love, and friendship.

Families living in dense forests or hilly areas form tribal communities.

The living conditions, language, dress, and marriage systems of tribal people are distinct.

In Karnataka, the Soligas of Mysuru district, the Koragas of Dakshina Kannada, and the Jenu Kurabas and Yeravas of Kodagu district are examples of tribal communities.

Since tribal communities live in forests and hilly regions, they are often deprived of facilities such as health care, housing, education, transport, food, and electricity.

In recent years, the government has been making efforts to provide education, food, housing, and health facilities to these communities.

A group of people living together to fulfill their basic needs and help one another is called a community.

Different types of communities can be seen in rural, urban, and tribal areas.

Many people work together to provide the food we eat, the clothes we wear, and the houses we live in.

No work can be completed without the contribution of every individual in this chain.

We should not think that things are easily available just by paying money.

We must remember the hard work of people involved in producing goods and food items and respect every occupation and every individual in the community.

In a community, apart from people who manufacture and supply goods, we also need people who keep the environment clean, provide basic necessities, entertain, give information, and offer relief.

Everyone in the community contributes to its development, and every occupation has its own value.

When someone in the community faces trouble, others come forward to help.

Similarly, during natural calamities such as floods, droughts, and earthquakes, other communities extend help to the affected community.
